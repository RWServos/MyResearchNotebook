# **My Experience with Big Data**
***
My first experience with big data occurred when I began working for the Canadian Red Cross two years ago. As a coordinator for the disaster management operations team, I used internal disaster statistics to create disaster maps in order to improve the quality of our responses and services. I also created infographics about our operations for fundraising and public education purposes. ~~Ironically~~, these materials are not publically available, however, [the CRC has released a couple of infographics online](https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3842/14275011327_d91e081d28_h.jpg) which bear a striking resemblance to work I have done.

I also worked as a patient advocate and communications coordinator for an organization called the [Niagara Center for Independent Living](http://niagaracentreforindependentliving.org/). I was responsible for translating the [often convoluted language of government policy](http://www.mcss.gov.on.ca/en/mcss/publications/developmentalServices/policyGuidelinesAdultProtectiveService/5.aspx) into something more relatable for our clients, many of whom had difficulty reading or impaired vision. I found that the best way of communicating this often dense information was through infographic designs based on the [Canadian National Institute for the Blind's style guide](http://www.cnib.ca/en/services/resources/Clearprint/Documents/CNIB%20Clear%20Print%20Guide.pdf).

While I have been fortunate enough to work with data visualization frequently over the past few years, I feel as if I have only experienced the aesthetic, marketable side of big data, but not its potential as an analytic tool. My hope for this class is that it will give me the technical skills necessary to leverage both aspects of big data's powerful research capabilities.
