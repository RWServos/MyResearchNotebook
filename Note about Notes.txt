Note About Notes

My approach to creating the tags was to think of five different types of tags I think I thought I would typically use while writing notes, and then to find two examples of each in the reading. Obviously, I wouldn't normally have an even number of tags like that while taking notes, but I used this more as an oppourtunity to come up with some useful tags than to take comprehensive notes.

The basic tags I came up with were: key concepts, which could also include examples or definitions; quotations; supplementary concepts to be explored further; additional readings which are referenced or alluded to in the current reading; and data visualizations that catch my eye.

I can see why sharing notes and thought processes is useful when working on a project or with a team, but I feel sort of uncomfortable with sharing everything I write-- I feel like it will add a layer of self-consciousness to my work that could either help or hinder me. I'll be interested to find out.
